## Project Description

**Resumeker** is a web project for Engineering undergrads aiming to build impressive Resumes for their co-mates with no back-end technologies used.

***

## Problem Seen
Not many Engineers are good at working with MS Word to make Resume templates of their own.

## Solution Found
They can be helped by providing a platform with different Resume templates to choose from. Later, they must be filling out a form with all their details. These details can be accessed by developer in real-time, put them into Resume template chosen and mail them back. It is estimated that, it would take about _5-7_ minutes to put on the data into Resume template that's already designed. 

### Programming Languages Used
HTML, CSS and JavaScript

### Code Length
__~1300__ lines

### Editors / Tools Used
Visual Studio Code, Git Bash

### Web Hosting Platform Used
Netlify

### Mail Automation Platform Used
Zapier
